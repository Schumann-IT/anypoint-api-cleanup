      Internal teams are visible to all members of the organziation. All internal teams of an organization are under the root internal team.
      External teams are for grouping users that do not belong to the organization but collaborate with or consume content with the organization. All members of each team under the root external team must belong to the same master organization.
      Private teams are internal teams but are only visible by maintainers/members of the team.
      Shared teams are internal teams that can be mapped to external teams in other organizations where a trust relationship has been formed.
      Legacy teams are teams that cannot be moved and were migrated from existing Roles of the organization.
